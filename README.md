# Story Show Gallery - minimalist, vertical photo gallery, mobile friendly

Show a story with your photos in fullscreen lightbox without distracting elements. SSG is vertical and therefore great for use on smartphones. BTW: 63% of global website visits are from smartphones.

SSG is also in the form of a [Wordpress plugin](https://ssg.flor.cz/wordpress/).

## Main features

- SSG has **very easy setup**, it binds onto image hyper­links on the page auto­mati­cally. You can control this proccess by **CSS classes**. Define sepa­rate galleries, activate full screen mode, selectively deactivate SSG, etc.

- Story Show Gallery is fully **responsive** - works on a desktop, tablets and smartphones. SSG compares image size vs. screen size and place a caption to an optimal position:

- **Fullscreen** mode with an unobtrusive scrollbar and cursor. On smartphones, full screen mode works **like on YouTube**, it activates after rotating a phone into landscape mode.

- Story Show Gallery supports **Google analytics**. When a user views an image it is counted as a virtual pageview. You can disable this feature in the settings.

- There are **3 ways** how a photo gallery can be created. Automatically from images on the page, by passing an array of images into SSG, or by combination of both.

- **No e×it mode:** You can write just a minimal HTML code and SSG creates a gallery which works like a separate webpage. Because there is not much to display without SSG, the gallery can run in the no exit mode. See a [minimal crash course](https://ssg.flor.cz/minimal-crash-course/) how to use SSG.

- Story Show Gallery can display **watermark - logo** over images.

- **Jump scroll** automatically scrolls from image to image. Images are being gradually **lazy loaded** as a user scrolls down.

- Every image has its own address, so you can **deep link into the gallery** to show a [particular photo](https://ssg.flor.cz/#element).

- Animated transition between images combines sliding and fading. The visual effect is similar to old slide projectors.

- Protection of photos from being copied via right click menu.

- Story Show Gallery can load a **signpost** to other galleries behind the last photo. [See the sample](https://ssg.flor.cz/signpost/).
